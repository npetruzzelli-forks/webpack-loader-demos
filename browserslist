# BROWSER SUPPORT
# ---------------
# This file serves both as documentation and configuration using
# [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist). Some comments use the
# [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
#
# Lines starting with "#" are Browserslist config file comments.
#
# If a component has its own Browserslist config file, that file will be used
# instead of this one. See:
# -   [Browserslist's README](https://github.com/ai/browserslist/tree/1.3.6#config-file)
# -   [source code](https://github.com/ai/browserslist/blob/1.3.6/index.js#L228-L247)

# Made using Bootstrap 4 Alpha-6 as a starting point
# <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/eb2e1102be0f4641ee3e5c4e7853360d5a04e3d8/grunt/postcss.js>

# GOOGLE CHROME & CHROME FOR ANDROID
# Exact version number for Chrome is kinda arbitrary
Chrome >= 35
ChromeAndroid >= 57

# MOZILLA FIREFOX
# Rather than using Browserslist's native "Firefox ESR" version specifier string,
# we deliberately hardcode the number. This is to avoid unwittingly severely breaking the previous ESR in the event that:
# (a) we happen to ship a new software release soon after the release of a new ESR,
#     such that folks haven't yet had a reasonable amount of time to upgrade; and
# (b) the new ESR has unprefixed CSS properties/values whose absence would severely break webpages
#     (e.g. `box-sizing`, as opposed to `background: linear-gradient(...)`).
#     Since they've been unprefixed, Autoprefixer will stop prefixing them,
#     thus causing them to not work in the previous ESR (where the prefixes were required).
# Current Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR); https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/
#
# At the time of this writing, Twitter Bootstrap 4 Alpha-6 currently uses Firefox 38, but that has reached end-of-life
# Firefox 45 will reach end-of-life within the next 18 months. Firefox 52 is the most recent ESR.
# Out of leniency, we prefix these 1 ESR version further back than the official policy.
Firefox >= 45

# MICROSOFT EDGE
# Note: Edge versions in Autoprefixer & Can I Use refer to the EdgeHTML rendering engine version,
# NOT the Edge app version shown in Edge's "About" screen.
# For example, at the time of writing, Edge 20 on an up-to-date system uses EdgeHTML 12.
# See also https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/1928
Edge >= 12

# MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER
# Microsoft will only support the latest version of Internet Explorer for any
# given version of Windows. Microsoft has also ended mainstream support for
# Windows Vista. IE11 supports Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. No
# Windows Vista means no IE9.
# -   [Support for older versions of Internet Explorer ended](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)
# -   [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)
# -   [Internet Explorer system requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/11531/internet-explorer-system-requirements)
# IE 11 is the only officially supported browser, but we will spec one version back out of leniency
Explorer >= 10

# APPLE iOS & SAFARI
# Out of leniency, we prefix these 1 version further back than the official policy.
iOS >= 8
Safari >= 8

# The following remain NOT officially supported, but we're lenient and include their prefixes to avoid severely breaking in them.
Android 2.3
Android >= 4
Opera >= 12
